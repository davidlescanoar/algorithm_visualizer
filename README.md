# Algorithm visualizer
Algorithm Visualiser aims to be an application for visualising how algorithms work.

## Features
- We can visualize how DFS (Depth-first search) algorithm works.
- We can visualize how BFS (Breadth-first search) algorithm works.
- We can visualize how Dijkstra's algorithm works.
- We are able to change how the graph is given.
